# Snake-Game-Course
Implementation of snake game in Python following a linkedin course I found.

## Best Working Version
The best working version is going to be in lambda_expressions.py. messing.py will probably have some interesting things going on too.

## The Course

These files and their progression would have best been expressed as branches of the repository, but I didn't realize what the course was doing until I had made almost all of them. Sorry :/
